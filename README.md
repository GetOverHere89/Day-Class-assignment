# Day-Class-assignment

This was the final assignment for my first Java class. I got a 100% on it but I know that it needs improvement. I have been told that the code itself does not follow standards very well such as naming conventions. Also, although I attempted to catch any issues with certain loop statements, such as if the end user were to put in an incorrect day of the week, it still crashes. I haven't learned much about debugging or using exceptions yet as I am still pretty new to programming. I want to learn how github works so I thought putting this up here and seeing where it goes and how it all works would be a good way to learn! I hope to see some great improvements to my code! Thanks everyone!
